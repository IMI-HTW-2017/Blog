                    This is the continuation of the <a href="articles/kygo-kids-in-love-review-part-1.html">first part of the review</a> which I posted last week. The next song, <em>With you</em>, is more down to earth than the previous ones. This very emotional song, which is sung by Wrabel, is about a guy who was left by his girlfriend, but he still is deeply in love with her. The song also delivers a political statement: The lines "Staring at a television / Something 'bout the world's gonna end" refer to the night of the election in the US. It shows the political position of Wrabel, who doesn't like the fact that Donald Trump became the new president of the United States.

                    The name of the album is, at the same time, the name of a song in this album. <em>Kids in Love</em> is dominated by piano sounds which are typical for Kygo. The vocals of this song are sung by The Night Game and Maja Francis. The lyrics tell the story of two kids that were in love in their childhood, but then they grew up and their ways separated. Because of that they wish to be kids once again.

                    The second last song of the album, <em>Permanent</em>, which is sung by J Hart, is another track influenced greatly by Kygo's piano sounds. It tells the story of another gone love. It seemed to last forever, but then it broke up. Only for a moment it was permanent.
                </p>

                    The album ends with a slow, peaceful sounding track called <em>I See You</em>. In this song Kygo is accompanied by Billy Raffoul, who is singing from the perspective of a guy. This guy is thinking about a girl he has lost and is now searching for but can't find. Each night it keeps him up and he wishes that he could go back to the time they were together.

                    With this album Kygo has managed to show us again that his music is not like any dance music but it is also exciting, original, full of feelings and - of course - meorable.
