                    A week ago tropical house DJ Kygo released his new album <em>Kids in Love</em>. Over the week he dropped a single everyday until the album was finally released completely. It features many different vocalists from OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder to indie star Billy Raffoul. The album is a journey back in time to Summer high school romances and beautiful memories of childhood love. But while the first half of the album is all about the happy nostalgia the second half is more about that these romances will only remain as memories. Of course you can find Kygo's great piano sounds in his newest album, too.

                    The album starts with an uplifting tune called <em>Never let you go</em> which features british soul singer John Newman. It tells the throwback story of a young happy couple enjoying the summer and getting lost in this great time.

                    The second track, <em>Sunrise</em>, is a little more laidback, being about a guy who wants to enjoy the sunrise with his love and nothing will keep hin from her. It features american singer Jason Walker, who is known for his high voice, accompanied by some concise chords played on the piano by Kygo.

                    <em>Riding Shotgun</em>, featuring Oliver Nelson, is sung by Bonnie McKee, an american singer and songwriter. It tells the story of a girl who is living a crazy romance but is very happy with it and doesn't want it to ever change.

                    The song <em>Stranger Things</em> is inspired by the Netflix show of the same name. You can find multiple lines in the lyrics hinting at it by referring to the city the show takes place in and the name of the song/show is in there, too (of course). It features OneRepublic's frontman Ryan Tedder as singer.
