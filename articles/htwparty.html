                    This weekend, from 21st October at 10pm until 22nd October at 7am the HTW Party took place in the Kino International at Alexanderplatz. It is one of the biggest student partys in Berlin. This year there were four floors: There was a floor for 90s, Trash, Pop and Party; a floor for Charts, House, Black, Electro and Latin; a floor for Rock and Indie; and a floor for Deep House, Tech House and Techno.

                    I arrived at around 0:30am and this was what I saw first:

                    I almost thought about turning around and leaving, but luckily I met some guys from my course of studies so I hadn't had to stand at the end of the queue. We had to wait around one and a half hour till we got in, because there were too many people inside and we had to wait for some of them to leave.

                <p>
                    At around 2am we finally got in and went to the Techno floor. It was totally worth the wait! The music was great and all people were having the fun of their life! The other floors weren't as good, but they weren't bad either. But I only managed to find three of the four floors, and I still have no idea where the last one could have been. At 5am we finally decided to leave the party, because we were exhausted and tired of all the dancing and partying.
