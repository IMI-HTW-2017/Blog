                    German techno old hand Oliver Huntemann presents 14 tracks on his new record called Propaganda. The album was released on his own label SENSO sound. It offers 14 tracks that lie between minimalistic tech house and techno.

                    Its atmosphere is melancholic sometimes dystopian which the same synth sounds occurring through the whole album. There are no vocals in any tracks and one will mostly find the typical 4 to the floor beat in combination with raw saw sounds and punchy percussion. 
                    One exception is <em>Anonym</em>, which creates lot of atmosphere and also would have been a great intro. With the sounds used it reminds me of the stranger things intro, and i am sure that was one inspiration for this track.
                    Other tracks like <em>Poltergeist</em>, <em>Rotlicht</em>em> and <em>Egoist</em> have that typical Oliver Huntemann feel to it and sound like most modern techno tracks, but good ones to be fair. I am sure they work really well at a club or festival. 
                    But for it was tracks like <em>Vertigo</em> which make this album good. It is really progressive and has weird vibe. Huntemann does not use the typical ways to build a techno track like endless snare rolls or similar. Its a track to get lost to on the dance floor and a great one.
                    My absolute favourite is the second last track Trick 17, which contains of a really weird composition of sounds and melodies and really goes forwards after the buildup.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really like the things Huntemann has done of this album but its the same for me as for other techno albums, the format is just not right for this kind of music. There are fourteen tracks on this record but i think a release as two four track ep’s would have been better, because there tracks that sound very similar which make it boring to listen through the whole thing in one run.
