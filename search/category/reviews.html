                        This is the continuation of the <a href="articles/kygo-kids-in-love-review-part-1.html">first part of the review</a> which I posted last week. The next song, <em>With you</em>, is more down to earth than the previous ones. This very emotional song, which is sung by Wrabel, is about a guy who was left by his girlfriend, but he still is deeply in love with her. The song also delivers a political statement: The lines "Staring at a television / Something 'bout the world's gonna end" refer to the night of the election in the US. It shows the political position of Wrabel, who doesn't like the fact that Donald Trump became the new president of the United States

                        A week ago tropical house DJ Kygo released his new album <em>Kids in Love</em>. Over the week he dropped a single everyday until the album was finally released completely. It features many different vocalists from OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder to indie star Billy Raffoul. The album is a journey back in time to Summer high school romances and beautiful memories of childhood love. But while the first half of the album is all about the happy nostalgia the second half is more about that these romances will only remain as memories. Of course you can find Kygo's great piano sounds in his newest album, too

                        British producer Stewart Howard aka Lapalux presents a different sound on his latest record.
                        He uses elements from dubstep, industrial and even classic music. He arranges them with tender vocals, distortion and atmospheric synthesizers to create a melancholic overall sound
